                Redesigning Liquid
            </h1>
            <p>
                Liquid is a regulated crypto-fiat exchange that offer core products catered to professional traders. After launching retail features such as Quick Exchange and credit card funding to make it easier and more user-friendly for customers that wants to invest in digital assets, we knew we had to make an update to communicate better with potential investors at the very first touch point.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2019, I helped lead the redesign of Liquid's website by laying out foundations including information architecture, content strategy, and an updated visual direction for Liquid that our customers could resonate with.

                Introduction
            </h2>
            <p>
                Liquid was the result of the merging of our former exchanges Qryptos and Quoinex, which gained traction globally in the crypto space. However, we noticed a lack of engagement and conversions despite running promotional local events and numerous ad campaigns dedicated to the global launch.
            </p>
            <hr class="divider">
            <h2 class="section-title_medium">
                We had two questions: What is not working? How might we talk to users and potential investors in a way that resonates with them?
            </h2>
            <p>
                Upon conducting internal <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">usability heuristics</a> reviews as well as getting input from surveys sent out to visitors that didn't convert, the two main problems we found were:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The homepage doesn't talk about actual trading and how Liquid would benefit them as customers.</strong> We were talking about us, we didn‚Äôt make it about our users.</li>
                <li><strong>The overall website content¬†is verbose and has a lot of jargon and ambiguity,</strong> making it uneasy to scan and lacking clarity.</li>
            </ul>
            <figure class="project-img">
                <img loading="lazy" class="image" src="/images/liquid/liquid-old-homepage.png" alt="Liquid old homepage">
                <figcaption>Old homepage design from the agency we hired to do our initial branding.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                Several frequent traders also added that they couldn't resonate with the diver theme across our marketing site, promotional video, and illustrations. While our intention was about <em><q>Let's dive into an ocean of possibilites with crypto!</q></em>, to our traders unfortunately the diver imagery was associated with markets dipping... ü§ê
            </p>
            <p>
                It was apparent that we rushed to launch our site and so we overlooked¬†the content strategy and the visual language &mdash; important factors that affected the overall experience of the¬†site and how our brand is perceived by customers.

                After gathering our insights and research, it was time to envision our messaging and brand more concretely.
            </h2>
            <p>
                Working closely with the Chief Design Officer, I conducted a competitor research, made a content inventory, and constructed user personas also in direct collaboration with the product marketing manager and a product specialist for their help with pulling analytics and product proposition.

                Besides information architecture and UX writing for most of the web copy, art direction was also my main contribution.
            </h2>
            <p>
                Having a visual background in photography and filmmaking, art direction has increasingly been a passion of mine and also something that seems to be often overlooked in product design. How would we make this financial product <strong>striking, beautiful, and memorable</strong>? A good product should have both usability and aesthetic, and having an aesthetic that can resonate with the people (and their emotions) and the culture you're designing for makes a huge impact on user experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                Speaking of emotions, <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/donald-norman-s-three-levels-of-design" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Three Levels of Design</a> by Don Norman proposes three different levels that create emotions and bring up certain feelings in interfaces:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Behavioral:</strong> general understanding of a product and clarity creates positive feelings. Liquid isn't reinventing the wheel in the crypto trading platform space, our goal is to make things easiers and more accessible for our users.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Visceral:</strong> the visual language that appeals to a certain user group. Male traders and investors comprise 95% of the crypto space, therefore we keep in mind to use a formal, bold, minimal and professional visual design that match the Liquid's products as well as the industry's masculine characteristics.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Reflective:</strong> the final layer that connects everything together &mdash; how they embody the product which then impacts our users' everyday life and also the emotions that are associated with it.
                </li>
            </ul>

            </h2>
            <p>
                My colleagues took over this redesign project and crafted the final visual design after my departure from Liquid. The majority of my research and output made it to the official implementation, such as visual direction and content strategy.
            </p>
            <p>
                In February 2020, 6 months after I last worked on the project, Liquid finally launched the new marketing site featuring the homepage as the storefront showcasing a user-friendly platform built for everyone, from beginners to pros.
            </p>
            <p>
                We also launched a Pro page with a dark, premium look and feel, directing advanced crypto traders, professional and institutions to access core trading products that make Liquid the platform for maximum control over every trade.

            </h2>
            <p>
                Being a key member of this project was an amazing opportunity to learn not only about my own process but also my team and organization, even though I did not get to finish it. I learned a great amount of knowledge by practicing a ton and making mistakes, such as going straight to designing high-fidelity mockups without doing any wireframes or considering making prototypes to understand the whole picture of what we were building, and also redesigning something just for the sake of it &mdash; focusing on the ‚Äúwhat‚Äù without first understanding the ‚Äúwhy.‚Äù
