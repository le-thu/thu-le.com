                I was born and raised in Saigon, now known as Ho Chi Minh City. At 14, my family and I moved to St. Petersburg, Florida, where I spent the next decade immersed in a new language and culture, before eventually returning to the bustling streets of Saigon, the place I feel most at home.

                My interest in building things stems from countless hours spent with LEGO sets as a child, while I'd credit my passion for design to Photoshop, Illustrator, and Premiere Pro when I was dabbling in photography and filmmaking during high school.

                For the past four years, I've led product design at <a href="https://www.anduintransact.com/" target="_blank">Anduin</a>, a startup creating products and services for fund managers, law firms, and investors in the venture capital and private equity space. Before Anduin, I designed e-commerce experiences for clients worldwide across various industries at <a href="https://www.sai-digital.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SAI Digital</a>. Prior to that, I was a designer at the cryptocurrency exchange <a href="https://www.liquid.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Liquid</a> (acquired by <a href="https://bitflyer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bitFlyer</a>).

                <a href="/process">My approach</a> to solving problems is rooted in first principles, systems thinking, and bias for action &mdash; aiming to strike the right balance between user needs and business goals. What I get to do with the people I work with is immensely rewarding and satisfying, and I feel incredibly fortunate to be able to say this.

                Outside of work, these days I spend time reading books on psychology and human behavior, as well as surfing through blogs. I also enjoy journaling to clear my thoughts, documenting my learnings, and planning to grow this little site into a proper digital garden one day. ðŸŒ±

                Photography was a huge part of my life, sadly I don't have time for it anymore. My photos are on <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jstfd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flickr</a> (although Iâ€™ve since lost access to my account) and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jstfd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram</a>. Making <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@jstfd/videos" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vlogs</a> was another hobby that gave me a lot of joy.

                This site is handcoded by me using primarily good old HTML and CSS, and a bit of CSS with the help of <a href="https://chatgpt.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ChatGPT</a> and <a href="https://claude.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Claude</a>. Since the site is pretty simple, I usually just design and prototype directly with code in <a href="https://brackets.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brackets</a>, and sometimes I use <a href="https://www.figma.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Figma</a> to test typeface options. Typography is mainly system fonts, and <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Newsreader" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Newsreader</a> for headers. Everything is stored on <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a> and deployed via <a href="https://pages.cloudflare.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cloudflare Pages</a>. Basic stats are collected with <a href="https://clicky.com/101421242" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clicky</a>.
