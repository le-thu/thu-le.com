                I was born and raised in Saigon, now known as Ho Chi Minh City. At 14, my family and I moved to St. Petersburg, Florida, where I spent the next decade immersed in a new language and culture, before eventually returning to the bustling streets of Saigon, the place I feel most at home.

                My interest in building things stems from countless hours spent with LEGO sets as a child, while I'd credit my passion for design to Photoshop, Illustrator, and Premiere Pro when I was dabbling in photography and filmmaking during high school.

                For the past four years, I've led product design at <a href="https://www.anduintransact.com/" target="_blank">Anduin</a>, a startup creating products and services for fund managers, law firms, and investors in the venture capital and private equity space. Before Anduin, I designed e-commerce experiences for clients worldwide across various industries at <a href="https://www.sai-digital.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SAI Digital</a>. Prior to that, I was a designer at the cryptocurrency exchange <a href="https://www.liquid.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Liquid</a>.

                <a href="/process">My approach</a> to solving problems is rooted in first principles, systems thinking, and bias for action &mdash; aiming to strike the right balance between user needs and business goals. What I get to do with the people I work with is immensely rewarding and satisfying, and I feel incredibly fortunate to be able to say this.

                Outside of work, these days I spend time reading books on psychology and human behavior, as well as surfing through personal blogs. I also enjoy journaling, documenting my learnings, and planning to grow this site into a proper digital garden one day. ðŸŒ±
