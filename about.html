                I'm based in Saigon and have spent the last four years leading product design at <a href="https://www.anduintransact.com/" target="_blank">Anduin</a>, a startup creating products and services for fund managers, law firms, and investors in the venture capital and private equity space.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before Anduin, I designed e-commerce experiences for clients worldwide across various industries as the sole designer at <a href="https://www.sai-digital.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SAI Digital</a>. Prior to that, I was a designer at the cryptocurrency exchange <a href="https://www.liquid.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Liquid</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                <a href="/process">My approach</a> to solving problems is rooted in first principles, systems thinking, and bias for action &mdash; aiming to strike the right balance between user needs and business goals. What I get to do with the people I work with is immensely rewarding and satisfying, and I'm incredibly fortunate to be able to say this.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of work, these days I spend time reading personal blogs and books on psychology and human behavior. I also enjoy journaling, documenting what I learn, and planning to grow this site into a proper digital garden one day. 🌱

            </p>
            <p>
                I was born and raised in Vietnam until I turned 14. After spending a decade in a small town in Florida for school and work, I returned to Saigon with almost no clear plans &mdash; the only time I had ever done anything without a plan in my life, and it turned out to be one of the best things that happened to me.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since I was young, I've always had a deep curiosity and passion for making things. At 7, I'd spend hours building things out of Lego by myself. As I grew a litte bit older, I continued to explore different forms of art, including drawing my own comic books at age 10 and sharing them with my classmates. When we moved to the States, I didn't have friends then as I was learning a new language and trying to assimilate a new culture. Luckily, I discovered and taught myself how to use Photoshop and Illustrator which opened another new door for me. I remember earning my first dollars at 15 designing posters for my grandpa's musical band, and later on my first $100 in ads money for making YouTube videos about my travels after learning Premiere Pro.
