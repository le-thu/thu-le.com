            Advanced Dashboard Table for Fund Managers

        <p>
            One of my favorite projects working on Fund Subscription is conceptualizing and designing a brand new data table for our fund managers. This table allows them to track and monitor their investors' progress as well as additional granular data, all in one convenient location. With the ability to add custom columns and hide default columns that aren't relevant, fund managers have greater flexibility and versatility when managing investor data during and after a fundraise.
        </p>
        <p>
            While I can't publicly show the dashboard table in depth here, you can reach out to me and I'd be more than happy to walk you through the project in details.

                Why we needed a new dashboard
            </h2>
            <p>
                In the summer of 2021, we entered a partnership with a reputable New York law firm that specializes in private equity funds among other matters. They were interested in adopting Fund Subscription for their fundraising needs and to use our solution for all their customers as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                During initial discovery calls with the law firm and also ongoing discussions with other firms and existing customers, we realized that:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Each firm has their specific internal practices that they’d like to be able to reproduce on different systems they’re using; some firms ignore certain data points that other firms value above everything else.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We could keep adding more columns on the dashboard to meet these customers’ need, but that isn’t scalable for our platform and might confuse other customers who don’t have the need for more columns or additional information.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Applying a one-size-fits-all approach was impossible, and our simple dashboard couldn't scale to serve more customers and use cases. As a result, we needed to introduce flexibility and configuration options.
            </p>

                Building a modular and scalable dashboard where people can track workflow, form, and custom data points, and hide default data that aren't relevant
            </h2>
            <p>
                As we collected information and established our execution strategy, our CTO, <a href="https://twitter.com/ngbinh" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binh</a>, proposed implementing a more efficient backend for data storage and management system. To achieve this, Binh and <a href="https://github.com/tuananhtd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tuan-Anh</a>, the lead engineer on this project, devised a plan to create a new infrastructure called the data lake, which would supersede the outdated method we'd used for storing data in the old dashboard.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, I partnered with product to identify and categorize various column types that would be accessible to our users. We defined how these columns behave and what the user experience looks like. I also got another chance to work with our lead frontend engineer, <a href="https://twitter.com/nghuuphuoc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Phuoc</a>, to design and build the foundation for the table's frontend which required lots of new components and customization. He is a wizard and never shies away from any challenges.
            </p>
            <p>
                As the sole product designer on this initiative, I owned the design execution of the entire project, including:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Planning and conducting user research, competitor analysis, and broader problem space research for additional user insights
                </li>
                <li>
                    Reviewing and validating solutions with stakeholders and users
                </li>
                <li>
                    Translating concepts into prototypes and mockups ready for development
                </li>
                <li>
                    Defining and detailing user interactions and design logic

                CRMs as the mental model of fund managers and lawyers
            </h2>
            <p>
                Our customers, who are fund managers and lawyers, recognize the significance of managing and nurturing investor relationships, using CRM software to track interactions, notes, and other relevant information. By doing so, they can deliver better client service and drive business success. This aligns with our vision for Fund Subscription as a centralized system that fosters communication and collaboration, streamlines workflows, and offers insights into customer behavior. To provide a smooth user experience, I wanted to leverage the familiarity our customers have with these platforms.

                Keeping tabs on competitors
            </h2>
            <p>
                To stay competitive, it's important to conduct competitor research to gain valuable insights into what works well and what can be improved upon, as well as identify gaps in the market and opportunities for innovation.
            </p>
            <p>
                I noticed that our competitors offer similar capabilities, but their products have quite clunky and difficult-to-navigate interfaces. At Anduin, my team and I strive to provide technological advancements while also ensuring a pleasant and smooth user experience for fund managers, differentiating ourselves in the private market space.

                Understanding examples from other verticals and parallels
            </h2>
            <p>
                I've found that considering parallels and verticals is a valuable approach when conceptualizing new capabilities in B2B SaaS. It offers cross-industry insights to identify unique solutions, inspires innovation by examining how other industries tackle similar issues and allows for a better understanding of user needs and expectations resulting in the creation of more user-centered design solutions that meet the needs of the target audience.
            </p>
            <p>
                My past experience working in product marketing allowed me to get a chance to use tools such as Facebook Ads Manager, Google Ad Manager, and HubSpot, so I looked at them to identify commonalities in managing campaigns that could relate to how fund managers and law firms use software to manage their funds and investor data.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    One commonality is the ability to easily organize and manage campaigns or funds based on various attributes or performance metrics. They also offer tailored views and reports for specific user needs.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Another commonality is the use of intuitive interfaces with clear navigation and visualizations that allow users to quickly gain insights into campaign or fund performance.

                Key principles
            </h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Customizability and flexibility.</strong>
                Our users need the dashboard table to truly adapt to their unique workflows. That's why we make sure they can easily choose which info to display, add or remove columns, and rearrange the order however they like to create their perfect custom view.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Intuitive configuration.</strong>
                Customizing has to be a breeze. Clear labels, tooltips, and drag-and-drop functionality ensure configuring their ideal table layout is quick and intuitive every step of the way.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Contextual interactions.</strong>
                Just viewing data isn't enough. Our users need to take action directly from the table itself. With contextual menus and inline editing, they can update, delete, and perform key operations on rows and data seamlessly.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Performance and feedback.</strong>
                Throughout the customization process, the dashboard table provides system feedback via visual cues, error messages, and validations to maintain data integrity. And with optimizations like pagination and lazy loading, users can experience buttery smooth table interactions even with massive datasets.

                Results and impact
            </h2>
            <p>
                Within a couple of months, we completed research, design, and development and launched the MVP 🚀
            </p>
            <p>
                Customers were able to experience and compare the advanced dashboard with the old dashboard. Immediately, we started making continuous improvements based on user feedback and insights. More and more customers began requesting this feature as soon as they heard about the new capability from our GTM team.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the end of 2022, 66% of both long-standing and new customers were using both the old and advanced dashboard tables following the feature release. After implementing further enhancements to the advanced dashboard table, all our new customers requested to use this option exclusively for managing their funds.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most importantly, this marked a major milestone for our partnership with the law firm and expands our footprint in the private market space. We are now their go-to partner for fundraising and other private equity transactions, as well as a solution for their customers.
