                Comments: Document Collaboration
            </h1>
            <p>
                Of all the projects I have been involved in while working on Fund Subscription, I must say that working on comments has been my favorite. I got to imagine the collaboration experience and build the feature with my team from the ground up to streamline communication between fund managers and investors, making it easier for them to work together on subscription forms and supporting documents without having to leave the app.
            </p>
            <p>
                After launching comments in 2021, we successfully reduced the need for offline and email exchanges between users, making their process more efficient and user-friendly.
            </p>
            <p>
                Reach out to me if you'd like to understand the project in details.

                Introduction
            </h2>
            <p>
                In the world of fundraising, emails are often exchanged between investors and the fund side, including fund managers and counsel, in regards to the content of the subscription documents. This can be a time-consuming and inefficient process, as it can be difficult to keep track of all of the different conversations and to ensure that everyone is on the same page.
            </p>
            <p>
                To improve this experience, I designed a comment functionality that allows fund managers and investors to communicate and resolve specific issues as they work to complete the subscription package which including the subscription form and additional documents.

                Going back to our mission statement
            </h2>
            <p>
                From the beginning, I imagined this functionality being integrated into the subscription form and the additional documents that our users interact with on a regular basis, making it easy for them to find and use. Comments can be attached to specific questions of the form or document requests, and they can be replied to and threaded. This allows for a clear and concise communication between fund managers and investors, and it helps to ensure that everyone is on the same page.
            </p>
            <p>
                This collaboration capability also simply aligns with Anduin's vision of being a one-stop shop for fundraising activities. By providing a centralized platform for communication and collaboration, we can help to streamline the fundraising process and make it more efficient for everyone involved.

                Key principles
            </h2>
            <p><strong>Clear and intuitive interface.</strong>
                The comment functionality should have a clean and intuitive interface that makes it easy for users to locate and use the commenting features. Clear visual cues, such as prominent buttons or icons, should be used to indicate how to add, view, and respond to comments.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Contextual and granular.</strong>
                Users should be able to leave comments directly on specific sections or paragraphs of the document, enabling precise feedback and discussions. This contextual commenting helps maintain clarity and ensures that comments are tied to the relevant content, making it easier for fund managers and investors to address specific issues or provide input.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Real-time collaboration.</strong>
                Real-time collaboration allows fund managers and investors to engage in discussions and receive immediate in-app and email notifications when new comments are added. This promotes seamless communication and encourages timely responses, enhancing collaboration and productivity.

                Continual improvements and enhancements &mdash; More to our power users
            </h2>
            <p>
                Commenting was released in April 2021 after about three months of research, design, and development. It quickly became a collaboration selling point for Fund Subscription as customers started using it in their workflow. As of today, we're the only fundraising platform that truly offers a robust in-app collaboration and communication capability for users.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our data also shows that close to 70% of conversations via comments are initiated by the fund side as part of their document reviews to communicate change and additional requests with their investors. Understanding that fund admins and lawyers are our power users, we've been continually incorporating their feedback and requests into making the collaboration and communication experience across more uses cases even more efficient for people who use Fund Subscription for all their fundraising needs.
