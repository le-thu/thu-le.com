                        I definitely notice this when I use ChatGPT or Claude to proofread long-form work messages or drafts of my blog posts. It does give me useful feedback here and there, but in general it strips away my personality and quirks. I think moving forward when I use an LLM for writing: stick to grammar corrections and syntax suggestions, but keep my voice and authenticity. Even if my writing sometimes sounds a bit convoluted to machines or robots, I believe that’s just how humans communicate and express ourselves.

                            For example, having a frictionless to-do app means <strong>I end up with too many fucking tasks</strong>. Some things need to be unsaved, neglected, forgotten, ignored, left undone so better things can be done. Or so I can spend more delightful moments at ease, not doing but being.

                        Yep, I am guilty of this. Sometimes I optimize too much and everything just works so efficiently that I end up working more instead of using that time for something actually meaningful. Trying to create more meaningful friction in my life now.

Lots of people couch their opinions with citations, or “studies show”, or they create writing that is an attempt to shorten some portion of thought or history. But this mostly makes for less interesting writing. I think one should write as much as they can with their own empiricism, their own senses, giving the reader their own characterization of life or events.</p>

                        <p class="compact">At the end of your 20s, you want to have clear lists &mdash; what you love, what you hate, what you’re good at, what you’re bad at. If you know yourself well, you will know what direction to point yourself in and what ladder to climb. You will know what makes you happy, fulfilled, and powerful at work. You also want to have a community &mdash; interesting people that you’re desperate to work with again, and wonderful people who want to help you grow and attain whatever goals you end up having.
