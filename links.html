                        I definitely notice this when I use ChatGPT or Claude to proofread long-form work messages or drafts of my blog posts. It does give me useful feedback here and there, but in general it strips away my personality and quirks. I think moving forward when I use an LLM for writing: stick to grammar corrections and syntax suggestions, but keep my voice and authenticity. Even if my writing sometimes sounds a bit convoluted to machines or robots, I believe that’s just how humans communicate and express ourselves.

                        Yep, I am guilty of this. Sometimes I optimize too much and everything just works so efficiently that I end up working more instead of using that time for something actually meaningful. Trying to create more meaningful friction in my life now.

Often, this helps you find the necessary points of tradeoff that actually made the thing great.

                        <q>I think avoiding summary is even more important when writing, possibly it’s the first step to good writing. <em>You</em> are a primary source. Lots of people couch their opinions with citations, or “studies show”, or they create writing that is an attempt to shorten some portion of thought or history. But this mostly makes for less interesting writing. I think one should write as much as they can with their own empiricism, their own senses, giving the reader their own characterization of life or events.</q>

Move from formal mentorship to guided mentorship, from one-way teaching to two-way apprenticeship, and from classroom learning to hands-on shadowing. You might focus more on collaborative sense-making rather than individual learning, exploratory role growth instead of structured career paths, and learning through real-world challenges rather than rote learning.</q>
