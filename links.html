                        I’ve been using AI a lot for work and to improve how I write and articulate, but I never let it write for me. You may not have the perfect words for what you want to say, but it’s your voice, your thoughts, and that’s what makes you <em>you</em>. So I’ll never understand why some people would rather share writings that have been made out to be theirs when it’s clearly written by AI.

                        <q>I find that if I love something deeply, I end up loving it all the more if I locate its weak points. Often, this helps you find the necessary points of tradeoff that actually made the thing great. If conducted covertly, this particular mental habit allows you to love people more deeply and realistically, by noticing how the annoying thing about them and the great thing are fundamentally intertwined.</q>

                        <q>I think avoiding summary is even more important when writing, possibly it’s the first step to good writing. <em>You</em> are a primary source. Lots of people couch their opinions with citations, or “studies show”, or they create writing that is an attempt to shorten some portion of thought or history. But this mostly makes for less interesting writing. I think one should write as much as they can with their own empiricism, their own senses, giving the reader their own characterization of life or events.</q>

Difficulty requires ingenuity, and ingenuity is what makes you feel like you’re working toward your potential. The thing about potential, however, is that it’s invisible and can’t be photographed on a magazine cover. But having integrity is about trusting that it’s there, even if you’re the only one that can see it.</q>

Eventually, I looked up and noticed that my life was nothing like I imagined it would be. But it fit me.</q>
