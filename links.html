                        I definitely notice this when I use ChatGPT or Claude to proofread long-form work messages or drafts of my blog posts. It does give me useful feedback here and there, but in general it strips away my personality and quirks. I think moving forward when I use an LLM for writing: stick to grammar corrections and syntax suggestions, but keep my voice and authenticity. Even if my writing sometimes sounds a bit convoluted to machines or robots, I believe that’s just how humans communicate and express ourselves.

Some things need to be unsaved, neglected, forgotten, ignored, left undone so better things can be done. Or so I can spend more delightful moments at ease, not doing but being.

                        Yep, I am guilty of this. Sometimes I optimize too much and everything just works so efficiently that I end up working more instead of using that time for something actually meaningful. Trying to create more meaningful friction in my life now.

In particular I’ll remember everything better; everything will mean more to me. That’s because everything I perceive will unconsciously engage on its way in with the substance of my preoccupation.

                        I’ve been using AI a lot for work and to improve how I write and articulate, but I never let it write for me. You may not have the perfect words for what you want to say, but it’s your voice, your thoughts, and that’s what makes you <em>you</em>. So I’ll never understand why some people would rather share writings that have been made out to be theirs when it’s clearly written by AI.

                        <p class="compact">Writing a book is a horrible, exhausting struggle, like a long bout of some painful illness. One would never undertake such a thing if one were not driven on by some demon whom one can neither resist or understand. For all one knows that demon is simply the same instinct that makes a baby squall for attention. And yet it is also true that one can write nothing readable unless one constantly struggles to efface one’s own personality. </p>

                        <p class="compact">Aligning yourself in this way is difficult, but such is the case for the most meaningful endeavors in life. Difficulty requires ingenuity, and ingenuity is what makes you feel like you’re working toward your potential. The thing about potential, however, is that it’s invisible and can’t be photographed on a magazine cover. But having integrity is about trusting that it’s there, even if you’re the only one that can see it.</p>
