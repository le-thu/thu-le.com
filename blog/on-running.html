                <p>
                    I used to hate running with a passion. Couldn’t understand why my coworkers were so crazy about it. I used to think (and kind of still do) that they must be running away from something, since they seem to spend half their waking hours doing it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first time I tried running was in June 2021. My friend, who was getting into running alongside swimming, asked me to join her for a morning run. A minute in and I was barely catching my breath. After a few minutes, I gave up and ended up just walking around the block.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I’ve always loved walking. During the 2020 lockdown in California, I walked around my block for two hours a day, every day, for a couple of months. I was getting my steps in, shedding weight, and listening to podcasts to stay sane. Walking was therapeutic. Running though, that always felt unnecessarily intense.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anyway, I didn’t look at running again until March 2024. I was trying a workout routine where I’d spend 10&ndash;15 minutes every morning at home, five days a week, doing cardio. This was before I joined a gym. I was following some YouTube workout videos, one of them had me running in place as part of a HIIT routine. I saw how many calories it burned and thought, “Oh, this is way more effective than the other stuff I’ve been doing.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    So in May 2024, I finally signed up for a gym for the first time since moving to Sài Gòn. I realized I needed a proper physical space to get into the right headspace. At first, I didn’t plan to make running my primary cardio. I mostly used the treadmill’s preset routines, where you input some variables and it generates a session based on what you gave it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After a few sessions, I decided to design my own routine. But I quickly found out my form wasn’t great &mdash; flat-out wrong, really (thanks to my fiancée’s trainer at the gym, who noticed and told her, who then told me). I was mostly sprinting without realizing it, so I was constantly running out of breath. After watching a few tutorials, I tried again, and I felt the difference almost instantly in both my stamina and how I felt about the whole thing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My first proper run was in July 2024: 3 minutes at a speed of 8 km/hr &mdash; a jump from 1 minute (of unnecessary sprinting). I mean, that’s a 200% increase. Then came 6 minutes, and I thought, “Hmm, maybe I can do this.” It felt good. I decided to invest in a good pair of running shoes, the New Balance Fresh Foam X 1080 v13. Probably the first pair of shoes I’ve ever been excited about. They’re fantastic for running.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then I crossed the 10-minute mark. Then 12. Then 15. Then 21 minutes (2.73 km) on December 8, 2024. That may not sound like much to some, but to me it was a huge milestone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you’d told 2021 me that I’d enjoy running one day &mdash; actually enjoy the <em>feeling</em> of running &mdash; I’d have given you the judgiest look you can imagine. Granted, I mostly run indoors: gym, earbuds in, AC, predictable terrain and whatnot. Running is running. Sài Gòn weather can be hellish, and I’d rather run in peace than have to dodge people, babies, and bikes.

                        <li>
                            July 13: 4 km in 33 minutes
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            July 18: 5 km in 42 minutes
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                <p>
                    Crossing the 5 km mark is something I never thought I’d be able to do. I feel amazing. Kind of proud, too. After every run, I always feel better. Maybe my coworkers have a point after all.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I’m nowhere near marathon shape, or not yet. I’m not even sure if I want that. But who knows. At this point, I just enjoy running when I can. Right now I run 2&ndash;3 times a week. I’m still very much a beginner.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Like walking, journaling, and <a href="/blog/things-i-have-changed-my-mind-about-lately#music-preferences">looping the same song</a> &mdash; doing something over and over again is a therapeutic ritual. It keeps me grounded. I know there’s also a compounding return down the road. I think that’s really what motivates me, just as much as how I feel in the moment.
