                        Blueprints are blue because of the cyanotype process invented in 1842 by John Herschel. The process used photosensitive chemicals (ammonium iron citrate and potassium ferrocyanide) that turned Prussian blue when exposed to light. You’d place a translucent drawing over chemically-coated paper, shine bright light on both, and wherever the drawing’s lines blocked the light, the paper stayed white, creating white lines on a blue background.

                        Lobsters aren’t actually immortal, they just age differently. They produce telomerase indefinitely and don’t weaken with age like mammals do, but they keep growing, which means they keep molting, and eventually that process becomes so energy intensive that it kills them.

                        Carrots don’t actually improve our eyesight. They contain vitamin A which prevents night blindness if you’re deficient, but if your eyes already work fine, eating more carrots won’t sharpen your vision. Didn’t stop my family from nagging me to eat them as a kid though.

                        French sports retailer <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decathlon_(retailer)">Decathlon</a> started as a wholesaler selling Nike and Adidas before creating any of its own gear. They didn’t launch their first in-house brand Quechua until 1997, over 20 years after it was founded.

                        Credit cards with rotating 5% cash back categories require people to activate them each quarter because <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://thedecisionlab.com/reference-guide/psychology/sludge">sludge</a> (intentional friction, the opposite of <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://thedecisionlab.com/insights/policy/nudges-social-engineering-sensible-policy">nudge</a>) benefits the company.

                        Superscript numbers on EU menus are due to a 2014 regulation requiring allergen disclosure on all food, including restaurant dishes. The US requires allergen info on packaged foods, but most restaurants aren’t required to disclose allergens on menus at all, so you mostly have to rely on your server.

                        <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brunch">Brunch</a> was invented by a hungover British writer in 1895 who wanted a lighter Sunday meal that let people who got drunk on Saturday night sleep in. It didn’t become a cultural phenomenon until post-WWII America, when women entering the workforce pushed families to eat out on Sundays instead of cooking elaborate meals at home.

                        Fizzy drinks don’t help digest greasy food. The relief we feel after drinking Coke or Pepsi with a heavy meal is from releasing gas, not actual digestion. Carbonation can even worsen acid reflux and adds more gas to the stomach. Fast food chains keep pairing sodas with greasy food because fountain drinks cost pennies to make and sell for dollars, so profit margins are massive (<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.mashed.com/69317/fast-food-restaurants-really-make-money/">90%</a>). The more we associate that satisfying burp with digestive relief, the more they profit.

                        There’s a real medical term for why we pass gas more on airplanes: <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-altitude_flatus_expulsion">high altitude flatus expulsion</a> (HAFE). Airplane cabins are pressurized to 6,000–8,000 feet, so the gas in our intestines expands by about 25–30% mid-flight according to Boyle’s Law. It’s the same reason chip bags puff up during flight. So it’s merely physics, not poor manners.

                        Ceviche, one of my favorites, turns out to be a fusion dish. Ancient Peruvians used fermented passionfruit juice to preserve fish. Then Spanish colonizers brought citrus in the 1500s, and the lime marinade replaced the original method entirely.

                        Pacific salmon become zombies after spawning. They stop eating, burn through all their reserves, and their bodies literally rot alive while they’re still swimming, skin falling off, eyes going cloudy or even missing sometimes, fungal infections spreading. Their rotting bodies release marine nutrients that feed everything in the river, including the next generation of salmon.

                        In the Netherlands, Belgium, and much of Northern Europe, toilets are separated from bathrooms for practical reasons: hygiene and letting multiple people use facilities at once. Japan separates them too, but for completely different cultural reasons: the toilet is considered “unclean” and gets its own room (often with dedicated slippers), while the bath is sacred space for relaxation.

                        About 20 Japanese tourists a year develop <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_syndrome">Paris syndrome</a>, psychiatric symptoms severe enough to need hospitalization because Paris doesn’t match the idealized fantasy sold by Japanese media. Turns out marketing a city as a pristine romantic dream, then sending people from one of the world’s most polite cultures into actual Parisian service culture, creates a collision brutal enough to cause hallucinations and delusions.

                        In Japanese folklore, household objects like umbrellas, sandals, and tea kettles that reach 100 years gain consciousness and become <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsukumogami">tsukumogami</a>: conscious spirits that are mostly harmless, but become vengeful if thrown away carelessly. It’s folklore’s way of teaching respect for our belongings and the tools that serve us.

                        Research shows that when people feel nostalgic, they value money less and are willing to pay more for products. The mechanism: nostalgia makes us feel socially connected, and when we feel connected to people, we care less about money, which ironically makes us more willing to spend it.

                        Clever Hans, a horse who appeared to do math in the early 1900s, was actually just reading his handler’s unconscious body language cues.

                        The Zeigarnik effect explains why unfinished tasks occupy mental space even when we’re not actively working on them. Psychologist Bluma Zeigarnik observed that waiters could recall complex unpaid orders but immediately forgot them after payment. Our brains treat incomplete work as open loops demanding attention and only release that cognitive tension when the task is finished.

                        The word “<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dating">dating</a>” didn’t exist until 1896. A Chicago columnist coined it when describing someone whose girlfriend was “fillin’ all my dates” as in the dates on her calendar.

                        Marriage counseling was institutionalized by American eugenicists in the 1930s as the “positive” side of eugenics. These people also spent years advocating for forced sterilization, but pivoted to promoting “fit” marriages when the optics got bad.

                        We all have invisible zebra stripes called Blaschko’s lines, and they map the migration paths of our skin cells during fetal development: V-shapes on the back, S-curves on the torso, waves on the limbs. Most of us never see them, but people with certain genetic mutations or skin conditions can watch these embryonic blueprints light up across their skin.

Given how old and vast the universe is, we should have detected something by now, but we have not.

                        All my life, I had thought you were supposed to spit out the seeds when eating pomegranates. Turns out pomegranate seeds are actually arils (juice sacs with seeds inside) and the whole thing is edible.

Efficiency doesn’t reduce workload, it expands what we think is possible, so we take on more.

                        While zebras and horses look similar, the former are vicious, aggressive and lack the temperament and social structure that the latter had when they were domesticated around 5,500 years ago, hence we ride horses and not zebras.

                        In billiards, skilled players don’t just sink balls. They position the cue ball after each shot to set up the next one. Reputation works the same way. Each time you follow through, you make the next opportunity easier. But one major breach can undo all of it, because trust is harder to rebuild than it is to maintain.

                        Vinyl records store music as a physical shape. The groove carved into the disc is a literal snapshot of sound waves. When a record plays, a needle rides through those microscopic wiggles and vibrates the exact same way the original music did, translating bumps back into sound.

                        Western Union started as a telegraph company in 1851. They started offering money orders in 1871 as a side service since they already had a nationwide network of offices, and by 2006 money transfers became their whole business.

                        The movie <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zootopia">Zootopia</a> has three different titles (US got Zootopia, the UK and Denmark got Zootropolis, and Germany got Zoomania) because each name change came down to trademark conflicts in that specific market. A Danish zoo owned Zootopia for merchandise. A German children’s book already used Zootopolis which sounds too close to Zootropolis.

                        Inside an <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igloo">igloo</a>, snow keeps us warm because air trapped between ice crystals makes it an excellent insulator. Body heat alone can create a 60-degree temperature difference between inside and out. The terraced floor design helps too, as cold air sinks to the entrance level while warm air rises to where you sleep.

                        In English, people say “close to my heart.” In Chinese and Vietnamese, the metaphor stacks vital organs to intensify closeness, so people say “heart and liver” (心肝), which means my darling, my irreplaceable person.
