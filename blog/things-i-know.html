            <p>
                Last month I turned 30, and I thought I'd share some of the things I've learned along the way. Here's to many more to come.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    I know that I love repetition and routine. It's how I stay focused and organized.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I know that taking breaks does wonders for my productivity and creativity.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I know that people like to hear others call their names. I know I do.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I know the importance of praising in public and criticizing in private.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I know that people can be more forgiving than you think when you own up to your mistakes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I know how to cook and how to enjoy cooking.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I know how to run and how to enjoy running. I never thought I could.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I know that I can soothe myself in times of crisis. I went through a couple of mentally tough periods in 2020–2021, and I'm so glad I was able to be kind to myself.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I know that listening is a crucial skill. If you can listen well and show others you do listen to them, you're already speaking volumes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I know that it's okay to say “I don't know.” If you can and want to, say “But I will find out.”
                </li>
                <li>
                    I know that I should be patient with myself and others.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I know that delivering feedback is an art that really takes practice and patience to master.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I know that there's joy in anticipation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I know that I've successfully quit social media.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I know that my love languages are acts of service, quality time, and physical touch.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I know that I have to learn how to avoid paralysis when I hear the question “How is everything going?” or “What's new?”
                </li>
                <li>
                    I know that I've become more introverted in the last couple of years, and I'm good with that.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I know that it's okay to change my mind. We change and evolve.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I know that it's okay to not enjoy going out and socializing as much as I used to.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I know that I don't enjoy drinking alcohol as much anymore.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I know that when things get tough and I feel like giving up, I have to keep going.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I know that I feel things deeply.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I know that I have to start somewhere before I can get to where I want to be.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I know that journaling helps me tremendously. It's free therapy.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I know that I like to be silly.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I know that I can be a big sap while watching movies.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I know that taking a moment each day to feel grateful changes how I see everything.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I know that I have a job with a great level of flexibility, challenge, and autonomy.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I know that I wouldn't enjoy my job as much if it weren't for my colleagues.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I know that it's good to have something to look forward to, and it's equally important to enjoy and savor the moment.
                </li>
            </ol>
